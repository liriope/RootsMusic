The Coens’ curatorial impulse can be glimpsed in different ways. The brothers go to great lengths to present the roots music authentically on screen by casting real musicians in their films (often legendary ones), whose on-screen performances are captured live and in full rather than resorting to dubbing or lip-syncing in post-production, the standard Hollywood approach.
				</p>
				<p>One of the keys to understanding the role roots music plays in the films themselves lies in how it helps create and shape the Coens’ signature tone, which is a complex mixture of irony, sincerity, comedy and tragedy, lightness and darkness. Roots music is often employed to generate and orchestrate this defamiliarizing tone by presenting contradictory or paradoxical tones though lyrics, musical properties, and the music’s relationship to the action on screen.
				</p>
				<p>Their commitment even goes beyond the films. For both <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> and <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i>, for example, they helped produce benefit concerts and albums that funded organizations devoted to keeping roots music alive and well in America. Their award-winning soundtracks have done much to revive and re-transit roots music to a new generation of listeners and have made substantial contributions to American culture.

				<p class="text-left"><span class="first-sentence-small-caps">I first became interested</span> in the Coens and American roots music when I saw <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> for the first time in 2000. I was an undergrad at Minnesota State University Moorhead, studying English literature. I remember there was a fierce blizzard that night, even by Minnesota standards, but a group of us decided to brave the elements to drive to the local multiplex cinema. I hadn’t heard anything about the film before seeing it, so I went into it with no expectations. I don’t think I was even aware that it was a Coen brothers film. There were lots of things to enjoy about the film, the deep south setting, the parallels to Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>, the mad-cap comedy, but it was the music that put me in a state of rapture. I simply had not heard that kind of music so prominently included in a big-screen feature-film before. Bluegrass, blues, gospel, early rock and roll, early country–it presented an intoxicating melange of American traditional music. It was music that my parents had listened to, played, and appreciated, and so I inherited an appreciation for it, but I always regarded it as old, obscure music that nobody listened to or cared about anymore except maybe older folkies who grew up in the 1960’s, when folk music experienced a resurgence in popularity by the likes of Bob Dylan and many others. Nonetheless, here it was, old-timey American music on the big screen, being re-presented to a new generation of listeners, a rich treasure trove re-discovered, excavated from America’s musical and cultural attic. It had a real authenticity to it, a depth, a sincerity that felt refreshing in the context of the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, when American music culture was steeped in so much modern, popular music. As time went by, the Coens released more films, and I began to notice that they seemed to have a genuine, deep interest in American roots music in general, exploring different genres in different films. I always thought it would be fun and interesting to write a book about it.
