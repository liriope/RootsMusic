          <p class="text-left"><span class="first-sentence-small-caps">rather than being thought of as directors</span> who include a lot of music, and often good music, in their films, the Coens should be properly regarded and celebrated as two of the most influential, devoted and thoughtful curators of American roots music in the history of cinema. The Coens’ curatorial impulse can be glimpsed in different ways. The brothers go to great lengths to present the roots music authentically on screen by casting real musicians in their films (often legendary ones), whose on-screen performances are captured live and in full rather than resorting to dubbing or lip-syncing in post-production, the standard Hollywood approach.</p><p>Their commitment even goes beyond the films. For both O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis, for example, they helped produce benefit concerts and albums that funded organizations devoted to keeping roots music alive and well in America. Their award-winning soundtracks have done much to revive and re-transit roots music to a new generation of listeners and have made substantial contributions to American culture.</p><p>One of the keys to understanding the role roots music plays in the films themselves lies in how it helps create and shape the Coens’ signature tone, which is a complex mixture of irony, sincerity, comedy and tragedy, lightness and darkness. Roots music is often employed to generate and orchestrate this defamiliarizing tone by presenting contradictory or paradoxical tones though lyrics, musical properties, and the music’s relationship to the action on screen.</p>

            <p class="text-left"><span class="first-sentence-small-caps">a broad category that embraces a diverse range</span> of musical genres, American roots music embraces blues, gospel, country, bluegrass, and other forms considered to form the vernacular sources or “roots'' of traditional American music. No other musical forms have done more to define American music than roots, and no other filmmakers have presented American roots music on screen as compellingly, as humorously, or as poetically, as the Coen brothers. The enchanting, old-timey tunes in O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the rousing, divine gospel of The Ladykillers, the eccentric playlist of The Big Lebowski–these films are characterized by thoughtfully curated soundtracks in which the Coens, along with their musical archivist and producer T-Bone Burnett, excavate America’s musical past to re-present half-forgotten yet unforgettable genres, artists, and songs that are not only important to American cultural history, but are also used to shape the Coens’ quirky, comi-tragic stories in entertaining and interesting ways.</p>
            <p>Why have the brothers turned to this genre again and again throughout their career? What is the Coens’ creative process in terms of incorporating roots music into their films? What is special or significant about the Coens’ use of roots music in the context of American film and culture? What are the various functions, critical and aesthetic, that roots music plays in the films themselves? One of the keys to addressing many of these questions is by thinking about the Coens as serious curators of American roots music whose job involves, like professional museum curators, a complex admixture of scholarship, public engagement, cultural preservation and re-presentation, contextualization, entertainment, and narrative. Another key to fully understanding the Coens use of roots music and what makes it so analytically stimulating is how they employ roots music to construct multiple layers of complex meaning in relation to the story and the action on screen, filtered and orchestrated through a distinctive, tragi-comic tone that fuses irony and sincerity into a compound-complex sensibility that cannot be easily described or pinned down yet has been felt by countless viewers of Coen brother films. This peculiar tone, in fact, is one of the most identifiable and celebrated facets of Coen auteurism. Film critic Josh Levine calls this unique tone, “that Coen brothers feeling,” which elicits in viewers “a messy combination of intellectual and emotional responses that don’t easily resolve themselves into a simple statement.” The job of this book is to contend with this messy combination of intellectual and emotional responses, not to resolve them into any kind of simple statement, but to try to better understand how these responses are generated by reflecting on the central role that roots music plays in the Coens’ tonal key.</p>
